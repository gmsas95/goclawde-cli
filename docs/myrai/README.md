## What is Myrai?

**Myrai** is a lightweight, local-first personal AI assistant for the 99% - not just developers.

### Key Features
- 🎙️ **Voice-First** - Talk naturally, no commands to learn
- 👁️ **Vision-Enabled** - Sees what you see through camera
- 🧠 **Personal Memory** - Remembers facts about your life
- 🔒 **Private** - Local-first, your data stays with you
- 📱 **Works Everywhere** - Mobile, glasses, watch, home

### For the 99%

Not a coding assistant. Not a terminal tool. **A life assistant.**

```
"Remind me to call mom Sunday at 3pm"
"I spent $45 at Whole Foods"
"What's on my schedule today?"
"I'm at the store, what's on my list?"
```
